<a name='how-to-run'></a>
## How to Run the Code
The code can be run in two different ways.
One way is through *learning.py* that can be used to run small experiments on a local computer.
The other way is through the files inside the Job directory. 
We explain each of these approaches below.


<a name="learning.py"></a>
### Learning.py
```sh
$ learning.py -p1 p1
```

<a name="job_builder"></a>
### Job Builder




<a name='algorithms'></a>
## Algorithms
Algorithms are used to find a weight vector, **w**, such that the dot product of **w** and the feature vector, 
approximates the value function. 

<a name='glossary'></a>
### Algorithm Glossary
> Here, we briefly explain all the symbols and variables names that we use in our implementation.

#### parameters
- Common parameters of all algorithms:
  - Alpha (α): is the step size for the main learned weight vector `w`.
  - 


#### rules

### Off-policy TD

**Paper** [Off-Policy Temporal-Difference Learning with Function Approximation](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/publications/PSD-01.pdf)<br>
**Author** Doina Precup, Richard S. Sutton, Sanjoy Dasgupta<br>

#### Main update rule:
```python
def learn_wights(s, s_p, r):
        delta = compute_delta(s, s_p, r, gamma)
        w += alpha * delta * z
```
where s and s_p are the current and next states, r is the reward, and gamma is the discount factor parameter



<a name='environment'></a>
## Environment
At the heart of an environment is an MDP.
The MDP defines the states, actions, rewards, transition probability matrix, and the discount factor.

### Chain

<a name='tasks'></a>
## Tasks
A task, or a problem, uses an environment along with a target and behavior policy.
With this definition, multiple tasks could be defined on one environment.
